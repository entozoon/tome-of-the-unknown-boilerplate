# Tome of the Unkown - Boilerplate

[Check out the demo!](https://entozoon.github.io/tome-of-the-unknown/)

Using the NPM package
[Tome of the Unknown](https://github.com/entozoon/tome-of-the-unknown).

## Develop

    npm start

## Deploying

Build the project into the /docs directory (which github is set up to use), by:

    npm run build-prod
    Then commit and push as normal

NOTE: It takes a minutes for github to (automatically) update its live server
with your branch. Also, theoretically it can cache for 10 minutes but I've not
witnessed that.
